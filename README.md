### 🛠️ Example Usage (`curl`)

1.  **Login to Get a Token**
    *(Replace with your registered credentials)*
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/user/login \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
    
    # RESPONSE: {"token":"YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"}
    ```

2.  **Create a Project**
    *(Use the token received from the login step)*
    ```bash
    TOKEN="YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" # Replace with your actual token
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/project \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
      -d '{"name":"My Website","description":"Personal portfolio","link":"[https://my-website.com](https://my-website.com)"}'
    ```

3.  **List Your Projects**
    ```bash
    TOKEN="YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" # Replace with your actual token
    curl http://localhost:8080/project \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
    ```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

The application is configured using the `docker-compose.yaml` file, which sets the necessary environment variables for each service. You can modify this file to change the configuration.

| Service   | Variable         | Description                        | Default Value                     |
| :-------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `backend` | `DB_USER`        | PostgreSQL username.               | `postgres`                        |
| `backend` | `DB_PASSWORD`    | PostgreSQL password.               | `yourpassword`                    |
| `backend` | `DB_NAME`        | Database name.                     | `openanalytics`                   |
| `backend` | `JWT_SECRET`     | Secret key for signing JWTs.       | `supersecretkey`                  |
| `frontend`| `VITE_BACKEND_URL`| URL for the backend API.           | `http://backend:8080`             |

## 👨‍💻 Development Tips

-   💾 **Database Persistence**: A Docker volume (`postgres-data`) is used to persist PostgreSQL data across container restarts. To start fresh, you can remove this volume with `docker volume rm trackly_postgres-data`.
-   🔄 **Live Reload**: The frontend service uses Vite's development server, so changes to the React code will auto-reload in the browser. For backend changes, you will need to rebuild the container with `docker-compose up -d --build`.
-   🧪 **Testing API**: Use a REST client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or the provided `curl` examples to interact with the backend API quickly.
